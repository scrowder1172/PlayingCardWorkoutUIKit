# Playing Card Workout (UIKit)

This project is based off Sean Allen's iOS Dev beginner course. This project includes two branches. One branch is for the storyboard version. The other branch is for the UIKit programmatic version. The user is given a random card which will then tell them which workout to perform.

## How to install

1. fork the project or download the .zip
2. open project in XCode v15 or later (earlier versions may or may not compile correctly)
3. run in simulator
